# Bank-Loan-Approval-System
In this Open Ended Problem, the team has developed a system for whether a loan request made by the applicant should be approved or not. Here the user input is taken from a basic layout form, then the input is to the CART algorithm which uses two import factors â€“ information gain & gini index to produce the purest possible distribution of labels at each node by asking the best question for partitioning the input dataset.
The training data set is used to train the learning complying the algorithm. The tree is also result as an output for decision making. The input is then given to classify and obtain the prediction result.

The code is implemented in python using the Jupyter Notebook(Web-browser based IDE). The user input is developed using ipywidgets. The output is the outcome from algorithm that with what percentage the decision can be predicted to grant the loan to the applicant.
